/*
Write a function sortYears() that takes in an array of years, and, using the built-in .sort() method,
returns that array with the years sorted in descending order.
You can test your function when youâ€™re ready by passing in the years array or by making your own array of years!
    */
// Write your code here:

let years = [1970, 1999, 1951, 1982, 1963, 2011, 2018, 1922];

// const sortYears = arr => arr.sort((year1, year2) => year2 - year1);

const sortYears = arr => {
  return arr.sort((a, b) => {
    return b - a;
  });
};
console.log(sortYears(years));
console.log(years);
