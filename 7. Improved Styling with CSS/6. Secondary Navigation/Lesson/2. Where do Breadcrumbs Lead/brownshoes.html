The code on the right has a simple breadcrumb structure implemented. However, these breadcrumbs don’t link anywhere.

Within brownshoes.html, update the href property for the breadcrumb links so they link to the correct pages. Our other pages are within the same directory as brownshoes.html so you won’t need to add any additional path:

shoes -> shoes.html
flats -> flats.html
brown -> leave this as '#' since we are already on that page

Using the breadcrumbs we can now navigate to the generic flats and shoes pages.

Now these pages need an appropriate breadcrumb list.

Add breadcrumbs to flats.html with links to the appropriate pages.

Add breadcrumbs to shoes.html with links to the appropriate pages. Since “shoes” is the starting breadcrumb, this page will only have one breadcrumb that links to this page ('#').

This single breadcrumb may not look useful, but users expect the site to stay consistent.
